1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews INNER JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id INNER JOIN businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
1|4|excellent food|6|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|6|Sushi World
2|5|Great wedding venue|1|2|2|Mandy|Kaling|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
3|3|not good service|2|2|2|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing
4|2|seedy club|3|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|3|The Beagle Nightclub
5|1|terrible plumbing|5|3|3|Angela|Jolie|5|Plumbing by Janet


2.There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

# THIS WORKS:
SELECT stars, comment, first_name, last_name, name FROM reviews INNER JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id INNER JOIN businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

# ONE PARTICULAR BUSINESS:

sqlite> SELECT stars, comment, first_name, last_name, name FROM reviews INNER JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id INNER JOIN businesses on reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE businesses.name = "Sushi World";
