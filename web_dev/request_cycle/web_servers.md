1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

**It is open source**

* "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things"
* It never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you to do anything you tell it to. Whether it is unintentionally bad or not.
* Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power.
* linux does not handhold 
* treat all users with respect

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* the best example I came across is to think of it like an apartment building. You only need one apartment , not the whole building. (or a container)
* A dedicated server would be that whole building and a VPS just that apartment.
    - will only cost a fraction of a server
    - can have comparible performance to that of a dedicated server
    - you can manage vps safely with a control panel via internet
    - you can choose what **operating system** you want

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

    When you are logged in as root, all apps are running with root priveledges witch has potential for holes that can allow damage to your system because things like Firefox, that have vulnerability can come into your system. 

    In root there are no restrictions that would prevent you from doing something harmful if you didn't know it.
