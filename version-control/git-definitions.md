# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  It is drafts of a projects that comes with a timeline. 
Why is it useful? You can go back in time . You can see in the present what has been changed. At look in the past at a previous version like a revision history. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a copy of the master , to create an alternate version of the master, or experiment with features on the master without loosing the original master. It is a way for a collaborative team to work on separate files of the master at the same time while being able to access the most recent version of the master. It is a work in progress 'of the master' 
* What is a commit? A commit is a final ‘commitment’ to a change or addition.
* What makes a good commit message? Using tone  and specificity are the best practices for a commit message. Tone should be a command and present tense. Specificity should specify what change was made, to reference while reading the messages. 
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict happens when Git sees changes from two or more sources that conflict because perhaps the people working on the same file in their branch changed the same line in the file or deleted it altogether. Git will mark the file as having a conflict. Git will tell you that there are unmerged paths.
